## Getting My HTML Markup Done

Firstly I will get my HTML and CSS basic markup done.

## Migrate To REACT

Now I will migrate all the Rough markup to REACT accordingly as I would plan the components needed in the page before migrating.
I may use materialize CSS Because I'm familiar With that framework. But Thinking to start with material-ui with react Which I always want to start with.

## Integrate with state.

I will integrate state by using React Hooks and Make all the onChange and onClick functions Ready for the further use.

## REDUX and Routes

Then When the application starts getting a shape I will use Redux for state management and routes with React router.
